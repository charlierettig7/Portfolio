# Portfolio

This repository is a small portfolio of recent work I have done in various topics in bioinformatics. 
It contains: 
  1)  Breast_Cancer_Histology_ML: An implementation and comparison of the performance of several machine learning     
      models on the prediction of breast cancer diagnosis using 2D histological images.
  2)  FM_Index_Implementation: Python and C++ implementations of two different FM index-based search algorithms for   
      exact and approximate query string matching (e.g., genome-wide pattern searching).
  3)  Pharmacokinetics_Modeling: Stochastic modeling of the concentration-time profile of a pharmaceutic drug.

Each directory contains the code files along with reports of results and further discussion/analysis. The reports explain each project in detail.
